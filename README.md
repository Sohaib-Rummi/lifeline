Blood Donation App - 
React Native Project- 

Designed to search for blood donors in emergency cases. It uses Google Maps to visualize the consolidated data of blood donors, receivers, blood requests, and urgent blood requests.

------------------------- ABSTRACT ---------------------------
The purpose of the system is to provide a robust and efficient system for searching donors and receivers. The systems system uses Google Maps for the identification of donors, receivers, and urgent blood requests. 
The existing system didn’t provide an efficient way to search for donors according to their locations. The existing system lowest visibility of the donors and blood requests. The targeted challenges are to minimize the
waiting time and search for blood donors as soon as possible. The identified gap lies in the lack of a unified and accessible platform that connects willing blood donors with individuals or healthcare facilities in need, 
creating a more efficient and organized blood donation network. The primary objective of the application is to simplify the process of finding and connecting with blood donors and receivers, facilitate real-time 
communication between donors and recipients, ensure the constant and diverse pool of blood donors and recipients’ networks. The proposed system holds immense significance as it addresses critical issues of blood shortage
and streamlines the process of searching for blood donors on urgent needs, the application aims to save lives and contribute to the overall improvement of healthcare systems.


--------------------------- INTRODUCTION --------------------------------
Blood is essential for the existence of life. A deficiency of blood (Anemia) can lead to severe blood transfusion and can increase mortality if the required blood group is not available during surgery, severe 
accidents, and childbirth. Fresh and required blood groups are hard to find in emergencies. There is no such efficient and robust system that provides the solution. Instant and quick solutions can be provided 
by blood donation systems on the app. Where users will be able to search for donors and vice versa through the chat system. The system will generate an SOS notification for the user in case of an emergency.
User profiling will be maintained to check the month duration of the donor. Blood banks may or may not have the exact blood group needed at the time. In this application, users can see donors nearby with details 
of the donors on a map. The system will be highly effective in case of emergency for searching the donors.


----------------------------- Problem Statement --------------------------
From the literature review, we came to know that getting blood on urgent and required blood groups is done by asking blood banks. Sometimes the required blood group is not even available in friends and family circles. 
The “LIFE LINE” application will allow the users (needed) to get blood outside friends and family circles so that patients get the required blood group as soon as possible. Google Maps has a simple use case to see 
locations and find paths, we can use maps to enhance the usability of maps by using different flags for donors and needed users. Also, the map will show the map the distance and path to that donor. Blood has classes 
that are called blood groups, by using filtration of the certain blood group map will show the donors accordingly. Accidents and extensive loss of blood during surgeries and childbirths need urgent need blood of 
particular groups. The application will allow users to generate urgent SOS requests for the blood. Donors nearby get notification for the blood donation on urgent need. Users can chat through the system to donors for availability.


--------------------------- KEY FEATURES ---------------------------------
1. User profiling
2. Open to donate (For Donors)
3. Request for blood (Scheduled)
5. Urgent blood Request (Emergency case)
6. Consolidated user data is shown on Google Maps for better visualization
7. Donors, receivers, blood requests, and urgent blood requests are differentiated using markers on the map.
8. User History is saved for future needs.
9. Built-in chat model for quick and fast communication.
10. Toxic comments filtration in chat using machine learning techniques (Vectorization).
